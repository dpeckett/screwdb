# picokv

An absolutely miniscule key-value store for Go based on an append-only B+tree design (ala. ldapd/CouchDB).

Every additional line of code and feature will be extensively scrutinized.

## TODOs

* Delete everything not absolutely necessary.
* Port Martin Hedenfalk's btree implementation to native Go.
